# MSDS420-Database-Systems-and-Preparation

All of these projects were part of my Master's of Data Science at Northwestern University. This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks where I used a variety of querying languages and text files containing queries that I ran from the command line or Neo4j. While some of the projects in this repository are just queries, others contain analysis portions where I mapped my results using Folium.
